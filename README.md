# Game Picker

A silly ruby script to use when we want to pick games.

## Pre-requisites
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- Shell (Bash or Zsh)

## How to use

1. In the directory with the script, create a `games.txt` file
2. Put the name of the game on each line
3. Run `./picker.rb` to parse the file and print a random name
